Other software usage
====================

Viewer
======

The software can be used as a viewer to check the recorded data but without the fitting functions. To open the data in Viewer, no pre-processing is necessary. 

Data analysis scripts (Python / MATLAB)
=======================================

*These scripts are in preparation*.

These scripts will be for analyzing the trajectory data (csv files exported from the Tracker) and the original point cloud data. 

We encourage people to share their own scripts. Please let us know through the forum (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/3dtracker) or the contact form (http://3dtracker.org/contact.html) if you have a useful code you would like to share. Also, you can find the old MATLAB scripts that were previously published with our paper, Matsumoto et al., 2013, (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0078460#s6). Even though these old scripts cannot be directly used with the new data format, they would be a good starting point to write your own codes.
