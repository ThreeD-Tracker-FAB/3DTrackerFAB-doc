Software preparation

Installing 3rd party libraries
==============================
The 3DTracker-FAB utilizes functions of many free software libraries. Please download and install the software below. You can download the software from our website at  http://3dtracker.org/downloads.html

1. OpenCV 3.2.0 (library for image processing)
2. PCL 1.8.0 (library for point cloud processing) 
3. Visual C++ 2015 redistributable (library for running the software that was written on Visual Studio C++ 2015) 
4. Kinect for Windows Runtime v1.8 (library for Kinect v1 camera and backward compatibility) 

.. warning::
    **DO NOT install the R200 driver** provided by Intel because the 3DTracker doesn’t need it. Also, some users have reported that updating the R200 firmware could trigger the malfunctioning of the R200 (see https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/163; https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/429).

After installing the libraries above, add the following folder to the environment variable "PATH":
C:\opencv320\build\x64\vc14\bin (change "C:\opencv320", to your install directory)
C:\Program Files\PCL 1.8.0\bin
C:\Program Files\OpenNI2\Redist
See how to add directories to the “PATH”: https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm


Installing main programs of the 3DTracker-FAB
=============================================
Download the prebuilt version of the 3DTracker-FAB from the website http://3dtracker.org/downloads.html
Uncompress the downloaded zip file. The extracted folder contains the software and data folder.  

.. hint::
    Because recorded data will be initially saved in the data folder, it is recommended to place the extracted data folder in a large HDD.
